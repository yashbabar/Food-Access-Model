# The Food Equity Access Simulation Technology (FEAST)
The Food Equity Access Simulation Technology (FEAST) tool — previously known as the Food Access and Strategy Simulation (FASS) tool — is a powerful platform for analyzing how changes in the food retail landscape, such as adding or removing stores, affect household food access. FEAST enables users to simulate and evaluate strategies aimed at improving food equity across communities.

## Behavioral Calibration (FoodAPS)

Household shopping behavior is calibrated to USDA's National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey (FoodAPS-1, 2012-13; 4,826 households). Parameters and their provenance live in `food_access_model/abm/foodaps_calibration.py`; the estimation script is `scripts/foodaps/estimate_abm_params.py` (run it on the public-use CSV files from ERS).

* **Store choice per trip:** logit in distance to the nearest supermarket/superstore, distance to the nearest other food store, vehicle access, income-to-poverty ratio, and household size (replaces fixed probabilities of 0.60-0.80).
* **Trips per month:** 12-13 food-store trips, slightly more with a vehicle (replaces 6-8).
* **Resources:** income below 130% of the HHS poverty guideline for the household's size and the simulation year (replaces fixed dollar cutoffs).
* **New outputs:** poverty ratio, supermarket trip probability, imputed probability of low liquid assets, and probability of food insecurity. Food insecurity depends on household resources only; FoodAPS shows no association with supermarket distance after income and assets are controlled, so store changes do not move it.
* **Validation:** `food_access_model/abm/foodaps_validation.compare_to_foodaps(model)` reports simulated values next to national FoodAPS benchmarks. Unit tests: `pytest tests/test_foodaps_calibration.py`.

# Tutorials
## Example Use Case

1. Add a Store: Place a new supermarket in an underserved area—for example, add
    "Charlie’s Market" to a park location.
2. Simulate: Step through multiple months to observe how the addition improves food
    access, particularly for households without vehicles.
3. Remove a Store: Remove "Charlie’s Market" and/or surrounding stores and examine
    how food access challenges re-emerge in the affected area.


# Explanation

## Introduction

The FEAST tool is a powerful resource for analyzing and
simulating the effects of adding or removing stores on household food access. This guide
provides clear, step-by-step instructions to help you navigate and utilize the tool effectively.

### Why Agent-Based Modeling for Food Access?
Traditional food access research relies on aggregate statistics and simple distance measurements. However, real household food shopping involve interactions between:
- **Individual Constraints:** Income, vehicle access, work schedules, family size
- **Geographic Factors:** Store locations, transportation networks, neighborhood characteristics
- **Economic Dynamics:** Price variations and store quality differences

## Key Features of the Interface

1. Map Overview
    -  Legend:
        -  Supermarkets: Represented by hexagons.
        - Convenience Stores: Represented by small triangles.
        - Households: Shaped like houses.
            - High Food Access: Green.
            - Medium Food Access: Orange/Yellow.
            - Low Food Access: Red.
    - The map is interactive, allowing you to navigate, zoom, and click on specific elements to
explore detailed information about stores and households.

2. Household Data

- Attributes available for each household include:
    - Income
        - Household size
        - Number of vehicles
        - Number of workers
        - Proximity to the nearest store (within a mile)
        - Transit time (public and private)
        - Food access score
    - Data is sourced from the Census Bureau and Google Maps, ensuring accuracy and
relevance. The data reflects real-world locations as closely as possible, with granularity
at the census tract level.

3. Community Data Bar

- Aggregated metrics displayed for the selected area:
    - Total number of households
    - Number of supermarkets and convenience stores
    - Average household income
    - Average number of household vehicles

# How To Guide
## How To Use The Tool
Step 1: Adding a Store

1. Navigate to the Features Tab.
2. Select Add Store.
3. Enter the store details:
    - Name (e.g., "Charlie’s Market")
    - Type (e.g., supermarket or convenience store)
    - Location (choose a point on the map using latitude and longitude).
4. Confirm the addition. The new store will now appear on the map.

Step 2: Simulating Changes

- Use the Step Function to simulate changes over time:

    1. Click Step to advance the simulation by one period (currently represents one
    month).
    2. Monitor changes in household food access metrics.
    3. Repeat as needed to observe cumulative impacts over time.

Step 3: Removing a Store

1. Select the store(s) you want to remove (e.g., "Charlie’s Market"). To select multiple stores,
hold down the shift or command key as you select. To deselect stores, click on the map.
2. Click the "Remove Store" button.
3. Confirm the removal. The store(s) will disappear from the map.
4. Use the Step Function to evaluate the effects of this change on household food access.

## Tips for Effective Use

- Analyze Community Needs: Before making changes, review community-level data to
target areas with low food access.
- Simulate Iteratively: Run multiple steps to identify trends and long-term effects.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues
**"Simulation taking forever"**
- **Normal:** Large simulations (50k+ households) can take 10-30 minutes per step
- **Solution:** Use reduced sample size

By using the FEAST simulation tool, you can make informed decisions to
address food access challenges and create impactful solutions. Explore different scenarios,
monitor the outcomes, and leverage the tool’s insights to drive meaningful community
improvements. Should you need further support or wish to provide feedback, our team is here to

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You will need python to run this application.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ICICLE-ai/Food-Access-Model.git
   ```

2. Switch to the appropriate branch
If you are running the application locally, then switch to the "reduced_household_request" branch.  If you are running the application in a production environment, then switch to the "staging" branch.
```sh
  git checkout reduced_household_request 
  ``` 

3. Install python dependencies from pyproject.toml
   ```sh
   pip install uv
   uv install
   ```

4. Get a free API Key at [https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html). This is only necessary if you want to create new data. The current database will hold brown county data.

5. create a file `.env` at the root and enter your API in `config.py`
   ```py
   API_KEY=[CENSUS API KEY (optional)]
   DB_NAME=[NAME OF DATABASE]
   DB_USER=[DATABASE USER NAME]
   DB_PASS=[DATABASE PASSWORD]
   DB_HOST=[DATABASE HOST]
   DB_PORT=[DATABASE PORT FOR DATABASE]
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

You can run this project on localhost with:
```sh
   uv run run.py
```
Beyond testing api calls, running this project and the front end service contained in the [FASS-Frontend](https://github.com/ICICLE-ai/FASS-Frontend) concurrently results in a user-experience
using data within the database.
